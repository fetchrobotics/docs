Mechanical Overview
-------------------

Do not operate Fetch or Freight before reviewing the mechanical
information listed below.

Environmental
+++++++++++++

The Fetch and Freight Research Edition Robots are indoor laboratory
robots. Operating outside this type of environment could cause
damage to the Fetch and Freight robots, and injury or death to
operators.

Drive Surface
'''''''''''''
 - The drive surface of the Fetch must be capable of supporting the
   entire weight of Fetch, about 250 lbs (113.3 kgs). If the surface is too
   soft, Fetch can get stuck and fail to drive. A commercial carpet or
   tile is recommended.
 - The drive surface of the Freight must be capable of supporting the
   entire weight of the Freight about 150 lbs (68 kgs) plus the weight
   of the payload. If the surface is too soft, Freight can get stuck
   and fail to drive. A commercial carpet or tile is recommended.

Incline Surface
'''''''''''''''
 - Fetch and Freight are ready for ADA-compliant ramps, which are at no
   more than a 1/12 slope. Ramps that are steeper than a 1/12 slope
   are unsafe and may be a tipping hazard.

Water
'''''
 - Fetch and Freight have not been tested for any type of contact with water
   or any other liquid. Under no circumstances should Fetch nor Freight
   come in contact with water from rain, mist, ground water (puddles)
   and any other liquid. Water contact can cause damage to the electrical
   circuitry and the mechanism.

Temperature and Humidity 
''''''''''''''''''''''''
 - Fetch and Freight are designed to run in environments between 15C and 35C.
 - Keep Fetch and Freight away from open flames and other heat sources.
   Never use Fetch or Freight around stoves or ovens.

Forces and Torques 
++++++++++++++++++ 

Joint position, velocity, and force limits are implemented in the
Fetch and Freight URDF file as well as in firmware. Firmware implements
additional power limits. These joint limits control the range of
travel of the mechanism and the allowable velocity to prevent
over-travel. These limits are enforced by the controller, and are
designed to prevent poorly commanded control efforts from damaging the
robot or harming operators.

The limits below are from the Fetch and Freight URDF files. If a
velocity or torque limit is not specified, no value is enforced.

Joint Limits and Types
++++++++++++++++++++++

The position limits for Fetch and Freight are specified below. These
"hard limits" are the maximum travel for the mechanism.

Mount Points
++++++++++++

Fetch and Freight both have mount points on top of the robot
base. Fetch also has mount points on the head and gripper. The table
below lists the fasteners that should be used and the max torques to
use when installing fasteners.

=========== ============ =========================

=========== ============ ========================= 


Gripper Modularity Interface
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The gripper interface is modular, allowing the gripper to be replaced with alternate
configurations. The gripper interface is based on an ISO mechanical standard,
Ethernet communications and 24V power. For further details, contact Fetch Robotics
for the `Gripper Interface Specification` document.
