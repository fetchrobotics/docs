Tutorial: Gazebo Simulation
===========================

Fetch and Freight have simulated counterparts using the
`Gazebo Simulator <http://gazebosim.org>`_ which you can install locally on
your system.

The Construct Sim provides a way to simulate a Fetch in Gazebo via
*their cloud service* using a single
`ROSJect link <https://rds.theconstructsim.com/tc_projects/
use_project_share_link/4ba9621c-e546-4353-848e-dc7326c8e467>`_ in case you
want to avoid the installation process.

Installation
------------

Before installing the simulation environment, make sure your desktop
is setup with a standard installation of
`ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 <http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu>`_.
Once your APT repositories are configured, you can install the simulator:

::

    >$ sudo apt-get update
    >$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-fetch-gazebo-demo

.. warning::

    Never run the simulator on the robot. Simulation requires that
    the ROS parameter use_sim_time be set to true, which will cause
    the robot drivers to stop working correctly. In addition, be sure
    to never start the simulator in a terminal that has the ROS_MASTER_URI
    set to your robot for the same reasons.

Starting the Simulator
----------------------

The ``fetch_gazebo`` and ``fetch_gazebo_demo`` packages provide the Gazebo
environment for Fetch. ``fetch_gazebo`` includes several launch files:

 * simulation.launch spawns a robot in an empty world.
 * playground.launch spawns a robot inside a lab-like test environment.
   This environment has some tables with items that may be picked up
   and manipulated. It also has a pre-made map which can be used to
   test out robot navigation and some simple demonstrations of object
   grasping.

To start the simplest environment:

::

    >$ roslaunch fetch_gazebo simulation.launch

.. figure:: _static/gazebo.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-centered

Note that all of the environments will prepare the robot by tucking the
arm and giving the head an initial command.

Simulating a Freight
--------------------

Freight uses the same launch files as Fetch, simply pass the robot argument:

::

    >$ roslaunch fetch_gazebo simulation.launch robot:=freight

Visualizing with RVIZ
---------------------

Even though Gazebo has a graphical visualization, RVIZ is still the preferred
tool for interacting with your robot.

   :end-before: embed-rviz-end

Running the Mobile Manipulation Demo
------------------------------------

There is a fully integrated demo showing navigation, perception
and MoveIt! working together on the robot in simulation. To run the
demo, start Gazebo simulator with the playground:

::

    >$ roslaunch fetch_gazebo playground.launch

Wait until the simulator is fully running and then run the demo
launch file:

::

    >$ roslaunch fetch_gazebo_demo demo.launch

This will start:

 * fetch_nav.launch - this is the navigation stack with a pre-built map of
   the environment.
 * move_group.launch - this is the MoveIt configuration which can plan for
   the movement of the arm.
 * basic_grasping_perception - this is a simple demo found in the
   ``simple_grasping`` package which segments objects on tables and computes
   grasps for them.
 * demo.py - this our specific demo which navigates the robot from the
   starting pose in Gazebo to the table, raises the torso, lowers the head
   to look at the table, and then runs perception to generate a goal for
   MoveIt. The arm will then grasp the cube on the table, tuck the arm and
   lower the torso. Once the robot is back in this tucked configuration,
   the navigation stack will be once again called to navigate into the room
   with the countertop where the robot will place the cube on the other
   table.

Launch it on ROSDS
-------------------------

.. figure:: _static/rosds.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-centered

As mentioned beforehand, you can run the whole simulation on the
`ROS Development Studio <http://www.theconstructsim.com/rds-ros-development-studio/>`_,
by The Construct, with a single click. The advantages include:

 * No installation required
 * Any operating system can be used to program Fetch robots with ROS
 * You can start testing and programming Fetch robots in 30 seconds!

In case you want to try it, you can just press the **Run on ROSDS** button
to start:

Simulation vs. Real Robots
--------------------------
The simulated robot may not be identical to the real robot. In fact, the
real robot is likely quite a bit better behaved. Also:

 * The simulator does not include the IMU. Therefore, there is also no
   base odometry fusion with IMU data, and the base_controller directly
   publishes all required TF data directly.
 * The simulated robot does not have the head_camera/depth/* topics due
   to limitations within the Gazebo plugins.
 * The simulated robot arm is not as well tuned as the real robot. The real
   arm will not wobble the way the simulated arm does when executing a
   trajectory. The simulated robot has also not been tuned with various
   payloads. It is best used for examining the workspace of the robot,
   and not the actual controls-related performance of the arm.
 * The fingers of the real robot gripper are driven by the same leadscrew,
   so the object will always be grasped in the center of the gripper. With
   the simulated robot, the fingers are independently actuated, and so the
   object may drift to one side.
