Introduction
============

This manual is intended to give Fetch & Freight R&D users information to
successfully install, use, and develop code on the Fetch & Freight R&D robots. The
software installed on both robots is based on ROS. Please visit ros.org to lean
more about ROS. To get started as quickly as possible; please start by reading
Section 2, Safety, it is important not to operate a robot before reading Section
2. If you are setting up Fetch or Freight for the first time please see the
tutorial videos for unboxing Fetch & Freight to learn how to properly unpackage
and setup the robots for the first time.

Before you Start
----------------

Before getting started, below is an overview of what you need to use and operate
Fetch & Freight safely.

* Fetch & Freight Safety 
 
 - Please read **Section 2: Safety** in its entirety before using either robot.

* Safe Environment 
 
 - Operate Fetch & Freight in an enviroment free of hazards. Specifically, stairways and large drop offs can cause personal injury and extreme damage. Avoid dangerous objects, sharp objects (such as knives), fire sources, or hazardous chemicals. A robot with a knife or hot object is inherrently dangerous.

* Space 

 - Make sure that there is enough space for Fetch & Freight to drive around and preform tasks. Both Fetch & Freight are designed to operate in ADA-compliant enviroments (Americans with Disabilities Act.)

* Development Tools 
 
 - To connect with Fetch & Freight, a laptop or desktop computer is needed. Ideally Fetch & Freight can connect to a wireless network but users can also directly to Fetch or Freight via an ethernet port on each robot. 

* Linux
 
 - Familarity with the Linux command-line is strongly recommended. The computers in both Fetch & Freight have Ubuntu Linux installed. Tasks can be preformed by logging in remotely by using ssh or other similar tool. Users can also directly plug in a display, mouse, and keyboard to the access panels on Fetch & Freight.

* Electrical 

 - Fetch & Freight charge using a power brick that uses a standard 120V or 220VAC power outlet.

* ROS and Fetch & Freight

 - All Fetch & Freight R&D software is based on ROS. Completing the beginner tutorials in Section TODO will help users understand how to operate and write applications for the Fetch & Freight.

* Fetch & Freight Support

 - Please visit the Fetch Robotics support portal at TODO  and login to review service information, modularity specifications, important safety updates, and submit hardware or software support tickets for your robot.
