    Pulling on the charge plug cable instead of the handle can cause
    damage to the cable assembly over time and could potentially cause
    injury to the robot or user.


Running Fetch and Freight
`````````````````````````

Turning on Fetch and Freight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To turn on the robot, set the :ref:`power_disconnect` (the red one
on the lower back of the robot) to the ON position and then press the
power switch on the access panel until it lights up.

Logging In 
~~~~~~~~~~ 

Once the robot is turned on, ssh into the computer of the robot using
the default ``fetch`` user account:

:: 

	>$ ssh fetch@ROBOT_IP

ROBOT_IP will be either an IPv4 network address, or a network name, depending
on the configuration of your local network. If your computer
and network is setup for multicast DNS (mDNS) then you may be able to use
``fetchXYZ.local`` as the network name where XYZ will be the serial number
of your robot (remove any leading zeros from the serial number).

Then create your user account if you have not already done so as shown
below.

Putting Fetch and Freight Away
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before turning the robot off, it is recommended that you tuck the arm.
When power is shut off, the arm will want to slowly fall and will be
more difficult to backdrive when in the off configuration.

To turn the robot off, press and hold the illuminated power button on
the access panel until it starts blinking. The power button will
continue blinking until the computer has successfully shut down, and
then power will be disconnected.
